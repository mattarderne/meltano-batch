       Using  AWS  Batch,  you  can  run  batch computing workloads on the AWS
       Cloud. Batch computing is a common means  for  developers,  scientists,
       and  engineers  to access large amounts of compute resources. AWS Batch
       utilizes the advantages of this computing workload to remove the undif-
       ferentiated  heavy  lifting of configuring and managing required infra-
       structure, while also adopting  a  familiar  batch  computing  software
       approach. Given these advantages, AWS Batch can help you to efficiently
       provision resources in response to  jobs  submitted,  thus  effectively
       helping  to  eliminate  capacity constraints, reduce compute costs, and
       deliver your results more quickly.

       As a fully managed service, AWS Batch can run batch computing workloads
       of  any scale. AWS Batch automatically provisions compute resources and
       optimizes workload distribution based on the quantity and scale of your
       specific  workloads. With AWS Batch, there's no need to install or man-
       age batch computing software. This means that you can focus  your  time
       and energy on analyzing results and solving your specific problems.
